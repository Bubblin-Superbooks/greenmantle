<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">had got nearly all the stuff aboard the trucks.</p><p>A young officer in what I took to be a Turkish uniform rode up with an aide-de-camp. I noticed the German guards saluting him, so I judged he was rather a swell. He came up to me and asked me very civilly in German for the way-bills. I gave him them and he looked carefully through them, marking certain items with a blue pencil. Then he coolly handed them to his aide-de-camp and spoke to him in Turkish.</p><p>'Look here, I want these back,' I said. 'I can't do without them, and we've no time to waste.'</p><p>'Presently,' he said, smiling, and went off.</p><p>I said nothing, reflecting that the stuff was for the Turks and they naturally had to have some say in its handling. The loading was practically finished when my gentleman returned. He handed me a neatly typed new set of way-bills. One glance at them showed that some of the big items had been left out.</p></div> </div>
